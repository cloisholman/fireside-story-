    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>the wind was a snarling beast threatening to bite.</p>
      <p>The windows rattled and woke the baby. </p>
      <p>The baby cried and Sam leaned down to calm the baby with his puppy eyes.</p>
      <p> All of a sudden, Sam remembered he remembered he had to pick up his dry cleaning.</p>
      <p> It was rather strange that he was thinking of his dry cleaning.</p>
